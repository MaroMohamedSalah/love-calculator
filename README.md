# love-calculator App.
### It's my first project with React.

# The idea is 💡:
* When the user enters his name and his partner's name the App will navigate him to another page.
* This page is the result page which will calculate the love with them and display the result which contains:
    * Their names.
    * Percentage of the love.
    * advice for them (eg. Look for someone else.).
* Then he can go to the records section and show all his records ( Still working on this section 😁 ).

# Skill used in this App 🧑‍💻:
> HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, React ( Routs, Recoil, Surge, useState, and useEffect ), APIs ( Fetch and Axios), git, and GitHub.
